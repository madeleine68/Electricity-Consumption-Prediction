# Electricity-Consumption-Prediction

In this notebook, I will go through a real-world dataset related to energy consumption. This is a public dataset download from US Energy Information Administration. Data provide the Residential Energy Consumption collected energy-related data for housing units occupied as a primary residence and the households that live in them. Data were collected from 12,083 households selected at random using a complex multistage, area-probability sample design.
## Objective
Build a model that predicts total electric consumption (KWH)
This is a supervised, regression machine learning task: given a set of data with targets (in this case total elelctricty consumption) included, we want to train a model that can learn to map the features to the target.
